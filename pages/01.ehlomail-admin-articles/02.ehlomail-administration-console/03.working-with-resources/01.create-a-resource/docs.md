To schedule a resource or location, users invite the equipment and/or location to a meeting. When they select the resource, they can view the notes about the resource and view free/busy status for the resource, if available. When the meeting invite is sent, an email is sent to the account, and if the resource is free, the meeting is automatically entered in the resource's calendar.

###### To create a resource

1.  1.  In the Resources toolbar, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">****New****</span>.

    2.  The <span style="font-weight: bold;">****New Resource Wizard****</span> appears. As a minimum, you must enter the resource name and enter the resource email address. Select the [schedule policy](/ehlomail-admin-articles/ehlomail-administration-console/working-with-resources/managing-resources) and add useful information about the resource in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">****Description****</span> field.

    3.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">****Next****</span> and add resource location and contact information. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">****auto****</span> is checked, information added to Building, Floor, and Room fields are automatically added to the Location Display Name field. If auto is not checked, you can add a location display name.

    4.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">****Finish****</span>.
