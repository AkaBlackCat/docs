A resource account can share its resource calendar so that a specified user can manage the resource calendar. You can also configure the resource account to forward a copy of the resource's invitations to this user.  When this is set up, the user that is managing the resource does not need to log on directly to the account to view the resource calendar.

1.  In the Manage>Resources page select the resource from the Resources list and in the gear icon click <span style="font-weight: bold;">View Mail</span> to open the resource account.

2.  Share the resource's calendar:

* In the Resource account's Calendar view, right-click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calendar</span> and select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Share Calendar.</span>
* In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Role</span> section, select either <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manager</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Admin</span> to give the user permission to create, accept or decline invitations and edit the resource calendar.  
* Select which message to send to the user to notify them that the Resource account's Calendar has been shared.
* Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span>.
* Close the account and return to the administrator console.

3.  Edit the resource account and set the forwarding address to be the user account you delegated to share the resource. A copy of invites are automatically forwarded to the account. 

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: The forwarding address can be added when you create the resource account as well.
