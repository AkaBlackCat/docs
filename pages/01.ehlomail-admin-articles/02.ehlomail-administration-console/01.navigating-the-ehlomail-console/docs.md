The administration console is used to centrally manage all mail servers and accounts.  From the console you can provision accounts, configure account settings, manage domains etc.

The administration console opens with the Content pane displaying the Home page. The Home page displays links to the most frequently performed tasks.

## Navigation

The administration console is divided into three columns.

   *   <span class="attribute">Home</span>. <span style="font-weight: normal;">The Summary column shows the number of accounts, domains and classes of service that have been created;</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">the Maintenance column shows backup status,</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">and the Runtime column shows the number of active sessions and queue length. The frequently performed tasks are linked from this page as well. Also the Help Desk page link is on this page.</span>
