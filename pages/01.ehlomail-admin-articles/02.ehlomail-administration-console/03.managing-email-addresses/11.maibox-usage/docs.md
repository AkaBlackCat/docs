You can see the last time users accessed their mailbox from the **Accounts** list. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Last Login Time</span> column shows the date and time the mailbox was accessed.  If a mailbox has not been accessed, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Never logged In</span> is displayed.  You can click on the column header to sort by date.
