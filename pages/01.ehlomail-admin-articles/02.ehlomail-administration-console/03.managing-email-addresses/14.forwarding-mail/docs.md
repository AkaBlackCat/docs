## Enabling Mail Forwarding

When you create or edit an account, you can specify a default forwarding address that the user can use. Users can change the forwarding address from their account Preferences tab.  

You can also specify forwarding addresses that are hidden from the user. A copy of a message sent to the account is immediately forwarded to the designated forwarding address. As messages come in a copy is sent to the forwarding address.

## Disabling mail forwarding

Mail forwarding can be disabled from the Account > select the account > Forwarding > Untick the "Allow the user to specify a forwarding address" option. When mail forwarding is disabled, the option to create a forwarding address and to disable local delivery does not appear on the user's Preferences Mail page and Mail Filters page.

If you disable forwarding but a forwarding address is already specified in the user's account, forwarding of messages continues until you remove the forwarding address from the account's Mail preferences page.
