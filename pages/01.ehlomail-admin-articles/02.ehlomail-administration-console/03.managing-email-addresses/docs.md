## Managing Addresses

From <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Addresses**</span> in the Navigation pane you can create and manage accounts, aliases, distribution lists, and meeting resources.

The toolbar for each address type shows the total number of addresses for that type.

## Accounts

You manage the following user account tasks from Accounts:

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Provision new accounts**</span> with the New Account Wizard. You enter account name, display name, password, user-specific details, assign the class of service, define aliases and forwarding addresses, and select features, themes and Zimlets the account can access..

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Edit existing account information**</span>.  When you open an account to edit, the header displays the email name, account ID, assigned class of service, account status, the mail server and the used quota for the mailbox. You can change general and contact information and features, create and delete alias and forwarding addresses.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Change / reset the password**</span> for a selected account. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Change Password**</span> link from the toolbar is a quick way to change a forgotten password. You can also edit an account to change the password.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**View an account’s mailbox**</span>. This lets you log on to a user's account without the account’s password and view the selected account’s mailbox content, including all folders, calendar entries, and tags. This feature can be used to assist users, who may be having trouble with their mail account.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Move a mailbox**</span> from one server to another server. You move the mailbox to another server and then delete the mailbox from the old server.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Expire Sessions**</span>.  This link immediately logs users out of their account. When selecting an account from the Content pane, if you click <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Yes**</span> for Expire Sessions, the current session of the selected account is stopped. If the user is logged in, the user sees the login page with a notice that the session has expired. If you think the account has been compromised, you should change the password to prevent access to the account.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Reindex a mailbox.**</span> If a mailbox's index file becomes corrupt or is accidentally deleted, you can re-index the messages in the mailbox by double clicking on the email account, expand the cogwheel menu and click Reindex Mailbox.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Change account status**</span>. Active accounts can receive and send mail. You can change an account status from active to maintenance, locked, or closed.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Delete an account**</span>. This removes the account. If you don't want to delete the account, but want the account to be inaccessible, you can change the account status to locked or closed.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**View the date and time that the account was last accessed**</span>. On the Account Content pane, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Last Login Time**</span> column shows when the account was last accessed. You can search for accounts by last login time.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">**View when the account was created**</span>.  This information is on the account header.

## Aliases

An alias is an email address that forwards all email to a specified account.  An alias is not an email account. You can create, delete, and move aliases.  You can view all created aliases from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Aliases**</span> Content pane. To see which account an alias is configured, hover the mouse over the alias address. A tool tip shows the account associated with the alias.
