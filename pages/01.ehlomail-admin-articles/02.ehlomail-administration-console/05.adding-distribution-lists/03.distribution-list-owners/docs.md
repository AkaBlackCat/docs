When you create a distribution list, you can add other user accounts to manage the distribution list.Â [Owners](/ehlomail-admin-articles/ehlomail-administration-console/adding-distribution-lists/add-distribution-lists-to-an-existing-account) can view, edit, add and remove members in the DL that they are assigned as an owner. 
You can add owners when you create the list, and you can edit distribution lists to add and remove owners. Owners manage distribution lists from their account's Address Book, Distribution List folder. If they are the owner, when they right click a distribution list, the Edit Group link is available.

### Add Owners to Distribution Lists

1.  Go to **Manage** > **Distribution Lists** and select the distribution list to edit.

2.  Open the **Owners** page.

3.  Click **Add** and enter the owner's email address. Only internal accounts can be made owners.

### Delete Owners from Distribution Lists

1.  Go to **Manage** > **Distribution Lists** and select the distribution list to edit.

2.  Open the **Owners** page.

3.  Select the name to delete and click **Delete**. The owner is deleted immediately.

You can add an account to a distribution list in either from the Account's Member of tab or the Distribution List's Members tab.
