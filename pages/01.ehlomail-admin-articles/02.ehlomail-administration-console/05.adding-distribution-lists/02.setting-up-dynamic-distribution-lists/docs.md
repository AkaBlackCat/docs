Dynamic distribution lists can be created.  When a dynamic distribution list is created, a member URL is created that is used to identify members of the list. When you create accounts, you can add the distribution list to the accounts Member of page and the account is added to the DL. When an account is deleted it is automatically removed from the DL.

You can create a dynamic distribution list and assign someone else as the [owner](/ehlomail-admin-articles/ehlomail-administration-console/adding-distribution-lists/distribution-list-owners).  They can manage the distribution list from their account.

A dynamic distribution list cannot include other distribution lists.

A distribution list can include email addresses listed in your company directory and you can add other addresses to the list, but email addresses you type are not verified.

1.  Go to <span class="attribute">Manage > Distribution Lists</span>.

2.  In the gear icon, click <span class="attribute">New</span>.

1.  In the <span class="attribute">List Name</span> text box, type the distribution list name to be used as the mail address. The list name cannot have any spaces.

2.  In the <span class="attribute">Display name</span> text box, type the common name for the list.

3.  In the <span class="attribute">Description</span> field, describe the type of list or usage.

4.  Select Dynamic Group.

5.  On the right, in the <span class="attribute">Add Members to this list</span> section, either search for names from the company address book, or in the <span class="attribute">Or enter addresses belo</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">**w**</span> section, type a complete mail address.

Names display, ten at a time, in the box below.  

If the **<span class="attribute">Find</span>** field is blank when you click **<span class="attribute">Search</span>**, the search results return the all mail addresses in the address book.
