A distribution list is a group of email addresses contained in a list with a common email address. When users send to a distribution list, they are sending the message to everyone whose address is included in the list. The **To:** address line displays the distribution list address; the individual recipient addresses cannot be viewed. 

Only administrators can create, change, or delete distribution lists.

When a user’s email address is added to a distribution list, the user’s account **Member Of** tab is updated with the list name. When a distribution list is deleted or the removed, the distribution list is automatically removed from the Member Of tab.

The Hide in GAL check box can be enabled to create distribution lists that do not display in the Global Address List (GAL). You can use this feature to limit the exposure of the distribution list to only those that know the address.
