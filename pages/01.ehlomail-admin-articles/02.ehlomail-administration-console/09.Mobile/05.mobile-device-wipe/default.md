If a mobile device is lost or stolen and you have set up the mobile policy <span style="font-weight: bold;">Number of consecutive incorrect PIN inputs before device is wiped</span>, the mobile device can be locally wiped clean of all data.

A locally (generated by the device) initiated wipe of the device is performed if someone incorrectly enters a PIN more than the number of times specified in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Number of consecutive incorrect PIN inputs before device is wiped</span>. This erases all data on the device.

In addition to the rules set up from the administration console to perform a local device wipe, users who use EhloMail Web Client can initiate a remote wipe from their EhloMail Web Client account to erase all data on lost, stolen, or retired devices. The Remote Wipe link can be found in their <span style="font-weight: bold;">EhloMail Web Client > Preferences > Mobile Devices</span> folder.
