After the mobile policy is set up, the next time a mobile device sends a request to the server, mobile devices that are capable of enforcing security policies automatically set up the rules and immediately enforces them.

For example, if a password has not been set up on the device or the password is not as strong as required by the mobile policy, the user must fix the password before syncing with the server. Once the server confirms that the policy is enforced on the mobile device, the device can sync. If a mobile device is lost or stolen, the device is protected by the following
policy rules:

* When the **Password re-entry required after inactivity** (min) is configured, after the number of minutes configured, the device is locked. To unlock the device, users must re enter their password.
* When the **Failure attempts allowed** is configured, after the password is entered incorrectly more than the specified number of times, a locally (generated by the device) initiated wipe of the device is performed. This erases all data on the device.

In addition to the rules set up from the administration console to perform a local device wipe, users can initiate a remote wipe from their EhloMail Web Client account to erase all data on lost, stolen, or retired devices.
