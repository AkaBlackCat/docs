| Enable Mobile Sync                                               | In order for mobile devices to sync to EhloMail Collaboration Server, Enable Mobile Sync must be checked. Users have  two-way, over the air synchronization of mail, contacts, and calendar data between mobile devices and the EhloMail server.   
| Enable Mobile Policy                                             | Check this box to set up mobile security policies that enforce security rules on compliant mobile devices. You can enforce general security policies including password rules and set up [local wipe](/ehlomail-admin-articles/ehlomail-administration-console/mobile/mobile-device-wipe) capability on compliant devices.*  |
| Mobile Policy Settings                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Allow non-provisionable devices                                  | If this is enabled, old devices that do not support device security policy enforcement can still access the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Allow partial policy enforcement on device                       | Devices that are capable of enforcing only parts of the mobile security policy can still be used. For example, the policy requires an alphanumeric PIN, but a device that only supports numbered PINs could still be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Force PIN on device                                              | Force the user to create a personal identification number on the mobile device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Require alpha-numeric password for device                        | Require that the password include both numeric and alpha characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Minimum length of device PIN                                     | This specifies the minimum length of the PIN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Number of consecutive incorrect PIN input before device is wiped | The number of failed login attempts to the device before the device automatically initiates a [local wipe](/ehlomail-admin-articles/ehlomail-administration-console/mobile/mobile-device-wipe). The device does not need to contact the server for this to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Idle time before device is locked (Minutes)                      | How long the device remains active when not in use before the device is locked. To unlock the device, users must enter their PIN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
*Only WM6 devices and IPhones support security policies set by the server. Older devices do not respond to security policies. After the mobile policy is set up, the next time a mobile device sends a request to the server, mobile devices that are capable of enforcing security policies automatically set up the rules you implement and immediately enforces them.
