The Search page can be used to see search results from queries made in the **Search** field in the admin console header. When you open this page without entering a search query, **All Results** is the default search and this displays accounts, domains and distribution lists in the Content pane.

If you do not know the complete name, you can enter a partial name. Partial names can result in a list that has the partial name string anywhere in the information. You can also use the EhloMail mailbox ID number to search for an account. To return a search from a mailbox ID, the complete ID string must be entered in the search.

In the Search Options section of the **Search > Navigation** pane you can create a more specific search. See [Advanced Search.](/ehlomail-admin-articles/ehlomail-administration-console/search/advanced-search)

## Simple Search

Simple search provides a quick shortcut to searching without keywords. A search executes the query displayed in the Search text box. The drop-down arrow at the left of the search box enables you to select the type of item for which to search, account, distribution lists, aliases, resources or domains.

For accounts, you can search by display name, first and last name, first part of the mail address, alias, delivery address, or mailbox ID. If you search using a mailbox ID, the complete ID string must be entered in the search.  

If you do not know the complete name of the type, you can enter a partial name. Any search within the type selected with that partial sequence in the name are displayed.  For example, if you searched for Sam in Accounts, the results could include Samuel, Samantha, Sammy, Samson.

#### To use the Search feature

2. In the **Search** field, enter the name or partial name or string.

3. Click Search. The Search page opens and matching types are displayed in the Content pane. The total number of results displays in the Navigation pane, **Search** > **All Results** line.
