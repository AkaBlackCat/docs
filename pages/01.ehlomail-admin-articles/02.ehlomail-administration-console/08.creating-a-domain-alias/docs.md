## Email address aliases

An email alias is an email address that redirects all mail to a specified mail account. An alias is **not** an email account. Each account can have **unlimited** numbers of aliases.

When you select **Aliases** from the **Manage Addresses** Navigation pane, all aliases that are configured are displayed in the Content pane.  To see which account an alias is configured for, hover the mouse over the alias address. The tool tip shows the account associated with the alias.

Aliases can be created when you create a new account and can be added or changed in existing accounts. From the aliases toolbar you can also create new aliases for an account and move aliases from one account to another.

#### To add an alias to an existing account

1.  Go to **Manage** > **Accounts**.

2.  Select the account and in the gear icon click **Edit**.

3.  In the Navigation pane select the **Aliases**.

4.  Click **Add**.

5.  Enter the  mail address and a domain, to complete the address.

6.  Click OK.

7.  Click Save.

#### To move an alias to another account

1.  Go to **Manage** > **Aliases**.

2.  Select an alias to move, and in the gear icon click **Move Alias**.

3.  In the **Select an account** dialog box, enter the account name.

4.  Select the account to which the alias will be moved.

#### To remove an alias from a specific account

3.  In the **Alias** text box enter the alias name to use and the domain for the alias. The domain must exist.

## Domain aliases 

A domain alias allows different domain names to direct to a single domain address. Domain aliases let users access the same site through different addresses.

For example, your domain is <span style="font-weight: bold;">domain.com</span>, but you want users to have an address of <span style="font-weight: bold;">example.com</span>, create <span style="font-weight: bold;">example.com</span> as the alias for domain.com. Sending mail to <span style="font-weight: bold;">user@example.com</span> is the same as sending to <span style="font-weight: bold;">user@domain.com</span>.

*   A domain alias is a domain name just like your primary domain name. You must own the domain name and have access to the DNS zone to configure the MX records in order to be able to use it as an alias.

### Adding a domain alias

Domain aliases are free of charge but can only be added by the support team. Please open a ticket with your EhloMail provider and they will be able to assist you with this request.
