EhloMail Server includes themes that can be used to customize the appearance of the EhloMail Web Client. 

The default user interface theme and the themes that users can select in the EhloMail Web Client > **Preferences** > **General** page are configured in the Class of Services available for your domain and you can change the COS settings for individual accounts.

You can configure accounts to either use only a specific theme, to be able to change to any of the themes configured by the account COS, or to be able to change to specific themes that are enabled only for the account.

#### Limit users to one theme

1.  Go to **Manage** > **Accounts** and select the account to edit.

2.  On the **Themes** page, select the theme that should be the **Current UI theme**.

3.  On the **Features** page, remove the checkmark from **Change UI Themes**. The UI theme is the theme listed in the **Current UI theme** field.

#### Let users access specific EhloMail themes

1.  Go to **Manage** > **Accounts** and select the account to edit.

2.  Make sure that the **Change UI Themes** is checked on the **Features** page.

3.  On the **Themes** page, check the radial button to **Limit the Themes available to users**.

4.  Check the box next to the themes you want to enable.

Save your changes.
