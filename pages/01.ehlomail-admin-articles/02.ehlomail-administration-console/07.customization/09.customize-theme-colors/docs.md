You can customize the color layout for the web client from the Global Settings Themes page or the Domain Themes page. On the Themes page you can select colors from a pallet table for the following user interface base colors:

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foreground color</span> is the text color. The default text color is black. This is not often changed.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background color</span> is the primary background color displayed in the client. This color is the background for the page. Variants of the color are used for buttons, background color of the Content and Navigation panes, tabs, and selection highlight. In the following image, the background color displays with the login section, the variant of the background color displays in the background page.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary color</span> is the color used for the toolbar.

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Selection color</span> is the color displayed for a selected item such as a message or an item selected in the Navigation pane.

*   Because changing the base colors from the administration console changes the colors for all themes, you may want to limit the themes that are available to your users to one theme.

## Adding your Logo to the UI Themes

You can replace the EhloMail logo with your company's logo globally or per domain.

The following logo files can be changed. Your logos must be the same size as the specified here or the image may not display correctly. These graphic files should be saved on another server or in a directory that is not overwritten when EhloMail Server is upgraded.

*   Company logo that displays on the login and splash screens for EhloMail web client and the administration console. The dimension of the graphic must be exactly 440 x 60

*   Small company logo in the upper-left of the EhloMail web client application and the administration console. The dimension of the graphic must be exactly 200 x 35.
