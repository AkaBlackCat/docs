You can change themes per domain. For information about how changing the colors works, see [Customize theme colors and logos](/ehlomail-admin-articles/ehlomail-administration-console/customization/customize-theme-colors).

### To customize the color scheme of the themes

1.  From the **Themes** tab for Global Settings or Domains, change a base color for  Background, Secondary, Selection and Foreground color from the color pallet next to each base color. You can also enter a hexadecimal color code for an exact color.  

2.  Click **Save**.

3.  Flush the cache. In the Informational dialog that opens, select **Yes**.

4.  Click **Flush** and then **OK**.

When users log on they see the new colors.

_**Note:** To reset colors back to the EhloMail defaults, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Reset all color of the themes**</span>.

### To change the logo that displays in themes

Make sure that your graphics are the exact size required. The login page  logo banner should be 450 x 100\.  The client logo banner should be 120 x 35.

1.  In Logo URL of the themes, enter the full company Web address that you want linked from the logos.

2.  In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Application logo banner URL of the themes**</span>: field, enter the  URL to the small company logo graphic file that is displayed in the upper-left corner of the client pages and the administration console pages.

3.  In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Login logo banner URL of the themes**</span> field, enter the URL to the company logo graphic file that is displayed on the login and splash screens for the EWC and the administration console.

An example of the logo displays in the preview field.
