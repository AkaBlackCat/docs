The EhloMail service is comprised of two important features: **email security** and **email functionality**.  The following article will guide you through the initial setup steps, so you can start using these services in no time.

## Email security

The email security part of the service is very important as it allows you and your clients or colleagues to enjoy a spam-free experience but also doubles as failover solution in case the mail server is not operational, courtesy to its integrated **Emergency Inbox** feature which allows you to access your emails through webmail and receive new correspondence for up to 30 days. 

## Email collaboration suite 

The main feature of the EnhloMail service is the Enterprise email collaboration suite which, depending on the plan you purchased, gives you access to a set of powerful tools that enable you to send and receive emails, share documents with your team, syncronise calendars, create tasks, manage resources and so much more.

In order to complete the transition to EhloMail and retrieve the MX records required for your email service to be functional through EhloMail, you need to perform a few actions. Please navigate to the next chapter for further instructions.
