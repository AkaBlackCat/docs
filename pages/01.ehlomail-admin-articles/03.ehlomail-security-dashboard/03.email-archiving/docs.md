The Archiving feature included with EhloMail eliminates data storage constraints and allows businesses to meet legal and regulatory obligations. The cloud archive with unlimited storage and a retention period available up to 10 years, ensures you stay protected and compliant. 

Once Archiving is enabled you will be able to instantly archive all inbound, outbound and internal messages which are received and are sent from your EhloMail server. This protects the email metadata ensuring that all mail is actually archived at the point of origin and final destination. 

Archived emails are Tamper Proof and off-site which means users are unable to manipulate the email content in anyway. You also have the ability to extract a binary replica of an email message, for legal purposes. 

The email archive also comes with advance search capabilities for the super-fast and easy retrieval of a specific email or
attachment.
