The EhloMail service is comprised of two important features: **email security** and **email functionality**. The following article will give you a brief overview about both so you can get familiar with your new email solution in no time. 

### Email security
The email security part of the service is very important as it allows you and your clients or colleagues to enjoy a spam-free experience, but also doubles as failover solution in case the mail server is not operational. Courtesy to its integrated [**Emergency Inbox**](https://help.mail.ls/email-user-help/emergency-inbox) you will be able to continue accessing your emails through webmail and send and receive new correspondence for up to 30 days.

After your email account is created, you will receive a separate branded email with instructions on how to login to your EhloMail Security by Proofpoint account, where you will be able to manage spam and check your quarantine queue. For more details we recommend having a look at the [Managing Spam](https://help.mail.ls/email-user-help/email-security/managing-spam) section.

### Email collaboration suite
The main feature of the EhloMail service is the Enterprise email collaboration suite which, depending on the plan you purchased, gives you access to a set of powerful tools that enable you to send and receive emails, share documents with your team, syncronise calendars, create tasks, manage resources and so much more.
