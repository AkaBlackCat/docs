You can forward an email message to someone else. Forwarding a message includes all file attachments.

### Forward an Email Message
1. Select the email you want to forward.
2. Click **Forward** on the toolbar. The text of the forwarded message appears in the body of the compose page, unless you have set your preferences to forward messages as attachments.
3. Enter addressees.
4. Click Send.

### Forward a Message as the Originator
You can forward an existing message as if you are the originator of the message. The forwarded notice is not added to the subject field and the header information shows you are the originator.
1. Right-click on the message and select **Edit as New**.
2. Address the message, remove existing address if necessary.
3. Click Send.

### Forward a Message as a Redirected Message
Redirecting a message lets you send an email message you received as if the original author sent the message. Redirect a message instead of forwarding it makes it easier for the recipient to reply to the original sender.
1. Right-click on the message and select Redirect.
2. In the Redirect text box, enter the recipients addresses.
3. Click OK.

### Set Preferences for Forwarded Email
When you forward an email you can choose how to handle the original text when forwarding an email message.
1. Go to the **Preferences** > **Mail** page, **Composing Messages** section.
2. If you want to prefix the original message, select either the angle bracket (>) or pipe (|)

_**Note**: If you have selected a prefix for reply messages, you must use the same prefix for both replies and forwarded messages._
