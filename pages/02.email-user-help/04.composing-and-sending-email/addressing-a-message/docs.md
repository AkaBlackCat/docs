The auto complete feature suggests names as you type into the To, Cc, and Bcc fields in a new message. A list of possible addresses from your contacts in which either the first name, last name, or email address starts with the text you typed is displayed.

As you continue to type, the list of matching addresses becomes smaller as fewer matches are available. The list disappears if there are no matches.

For example, to send an email message to David Brinks, whose email address is dbrinks@acme.com, when you type D, a list appears showing all possible matches, with the matching portions highlighted. In this case, it might display:
* Dale Edwards <ded@acme.com>
* David Brinks <dbrinks@acme.com>
* Erica Dodd <erica878@xyz.com>
* When you add an “a” (Da) into the To field, the list would display:
* Dale Edwards <ded@acme.com>
* David Brinks <dbrinks@acme.com>

### Use Automatic Address Completion
To select a match from the list, you can click the match with the mouse or use one of the following keys to perform an action:

* The comma, semicolon, Return/Enter, and Tab keys all complete the first match in the list and place it in the field.
* ESC hides the list.
* The up and down arrow keys change the selection in the list. Moving the mouse cursor over the list also changes the selection.

To select an address when composing an email
1. Type enough characters until the contact you want is the first match.
2. Press a quick key, such as Enter or the semicolon. The address displays in the recipient field.
