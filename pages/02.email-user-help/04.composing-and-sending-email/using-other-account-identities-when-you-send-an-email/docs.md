When you send email, it is identified with an email account. When your email account is set up, your account name is your primary identity. However, you can create other email identities called personas to manage different types of email.

For example, you can create one persona for your business email and another for your personal email.

If you have more than one persona or added external accounts, when you send an email you can select the account you want to use as the From address.

### Add Personas
Creating different personas allows you to use multiple email addresses from your mailbox. For example, you could use your primary account persona for your business email correspondence, and create a new persona for your personal email correspondence.

1. Go to the **Preferences** > **Accounts** page. Your default account and personal information is shown as the primary account.
2. Click **Add Persona**. The account name **New Persona** displays in the Account Name column and in the **Persona Settings** > **Persona Name** text box.
3. In the **Persona Names** text box enter a name to identity the persona to use in the From list when you are composing an email. This name does not appear in the email message.
4. In the **Settings for Sent Messages** section, specify the From information for this persona.
* In the **From** text box type the name that appears in the From field of your outgoing email messages. This is the name that is shown before your email address.
* In the drop-down menu next to the text box, select the email address from which to send messages. If this field is not editable, you do not have additional external accounts identified.
5. To direct replies to email messages from this persona to a name and address different from that which you configured in From.
* Select Set the “Reply-to” field of email messages to.
* Enter the name in the text box.
6. (Optional) To associate a signature with the persona, click Signature.
7. To automatically use this persona when replying to messages sent to a specific email address or when forwarding messages from that address:
* Select When replying or forwarding messages sent to.
* Type the email address in the text box. If you are entering more than one email address, separate the addresses with either a comma or a semi-colon.
8. To automatically use this persona when replying to messages in a specific folder or when forwarding messages from this folder:
* Select Replying to or forwarding messages in folder(s).
* Click the folder icon to select one or more folders from the list of existing folders or to create a new folder.
* If you are selecting more than one folder, separate the folder names with either a comma or a semi-colon.
9. Click **Save**.
