If you have been granted delegate permissions for another person, you can send email messages on their behalf. The message's **From** address includes both your email address and the person you are sending the message for. 

If you were given permission to send a message as that person, the person's email address is in the menu. When you select this, your address is not included in the message.
1. In your Inbox, click New Message.
2. In the From field, select the name of the sender from the drop-down menu.
3. Compose and send the message.
