You can define filters to manage incoming and outgoing email messages, including Calendar-related messages and Activity Streams. A filter consists of one or more conditions and one or more actions. You can base a condition on a subject, email messages from a specific person, or messages for a particular date. If the message matches the conditions, the specified actions are performed.

You can create filters to do the following:
* Sort incoming messages into folders. For example, all email messages from your supervisor are automatically moved into your Management Directives folder on receipt.
* Tag messages. For example, email messages from the corporate-events mailing list are marked with the Events tag.
* Forward or discard email. For example, all email messages received from a particular email address are moved to the Trash folder.
* Flag messages for importance.
Filters are applied in the order that they are listed. You can change the order at any time.

_**Note**: An email message is evaluated by each active filter, unless you specify that a message is treated only by the first filter that it matches. Usually, you do not want more than one filter applied to a message after the first match because the message can undergo multiple, perhaps contradictory, actions._
