You can apply a filter to email messages that you have already received. Using a filter is a quick way to organize email by moving messages into folders.
Go to the Preferences>Filters page.
Click Run Filter.
Select the folders to which to apply the filter.
Click OK.
A Filter run complete dialog displays after the filter has completed. The messages stated how many messages were processed and how many were affected.

### Apply a Filter to a Contact
1. Go to the **Address Book** > **Contacts** page and select a contact.
2. In the contact’s details in the right pane, right click the contact’s email address.
3. Select Add to Filter and select the filter or create a new filter.

### Editing a Filter
You can modify an existing filter.
1. Go to the **Preferences** > **Filters** page.
2. Select the filter that you want to change.
3. Click **Edit Filter**.
4. Change the conditions and actions as necessary using the drop-down menus.
5. Click OK.

2. Click **Edit Filter**.
3. Uncheck the **Active** box in the upper right corner to turn the filter off.
4. Click OK.
