You can use tags to help classify and organize your email messages, conversations, calendar items, contacts, briefcase, or tasks. For example, you can have a tag for **Immediate Turnaround** and another for **Medium Priority**.
You can tag for tasks or a project tag to sort email, and you can search for all items with a particular tag. You can also apply multiple tags to an item.

### Create a Tag
1. In the **Overview** pane, click the **Tags** gear icon and select **New Tag**.
2. Enter the new **Tag name** and select a **Color** for the tag.
3. Tag names can include any character except a colon (:), forward slash (/), and quotation mark (")
4. Click **OK**.
The new tag is listed under **Tags**.

### Assign a Tag to an Item
After you create a tag, you can apply it to an item. You can assign more than one tag to an item to classify it under different categories. If an item has multiple tags, the tag icon is multicolored. Only tags that are not already applied to the item are listed.
1. In the **Content** pane, right click an item.
2. In the drop-down menu, select **Tag <topic>**. For example, the topic can be a “**Conversation**”, which displays as **Tag Conversation**.
3. Click the tag to apply to the item. A tag icon displays next to the item.

### Remove a Tag
1. Right-click an item that is tagged.
2. In the drop-down menu, select **Tag <topic>**. For example, the topic can be a “**Conversation**”, which displays as **Tag Conversation**.
3. Select **Remove Tag**. If the item has multiple tags, select the tag you want to remove or choose **All Tags** to remove all tags.

You can remove a tag from a message when you have the message open in a reading pane. The tag displays in the message header under Tags, and you can click the X on the tag to delete the tag.

### Display Messages with a Specific Tag
To find tagged message quickly, click a tag in the **Tag** section of the **Overview** pane. All messages with the selected tag are displayed in the **Content** pane.

### Search for Items by Tag
To search for a specific tag, type the following into the **Search** field (without quotes):
* "tag:< tagname >". Displays all tags with this name.

_**Note**: If the tag name is two words, you must use quotes around the tag name._
    
### Change a Tag Color
1. Go to **Overview** pane > **Tags** section.
2. Right-click the tag for which you want to change the color.
3. Select **Tag Color** and click a new color for the tag.
All tags with the previous color are changed to the new color.

### Rename a Tag
1. Go to **Overview** pane > **Tags** section.
2. Right-click the tag you want to rename and select **Rename Tag**.
3. Enter the **New Tag Name**.
4. Tag names can include any character except a colon (:), forward slash (/), and quotation mark (")
5. Click OK.

### Delete a Tag
Deleting a tag removes the tag from any item that has the tag. The items themselves are not deleted.
1. Go to **Overview** pane > **Tags** section.
2. Right-click the tag you want to delete and select **Delete**.
3. Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.
