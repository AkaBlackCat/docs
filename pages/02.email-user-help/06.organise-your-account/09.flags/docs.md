The flag icon in the message list is a yes/no indicator that denotes whether the email message has been flagged. This can be used to indicate an action- needed item or to distinguish the message or conversation from other items of lesser importance.

### Flag a Message or Conversation
1. Place your cursor over the flag column for a message or conversation. The flag icon displays in a shadowed form.
2. Click once directly over the flag icon. The flag icon appears in its active form, which turns the flag red in color.

### Remove a Flag from a Message or Conversation
Click an active flag icon to toggle the flag off. The flag is disabled and the flag color turns to a greyscale color.
