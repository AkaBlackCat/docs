Each EhloMail account comes with an included Anti-Spam and Anti-virus solution, powered by Proofpoint. This service blocks a wide range of email attacks at the connection level, filters spam and viruses, and can approve or block messages based on sender address or domain, origin IP address, attachment size or file type, text content, and more.

### How does it work? 
The spam and anti-virus filtering is performed before the emails even reach the mail server and doesn't require you to install additional software or hardware. Legitimate messages are delivered to recipients with minimal delay, while suspicious messages are blocked or sent to the quarantine. You will receive regular reports (set to every 4 hours by default) called digests with a summary of blocked emails which you will allow you to review and release false positives directly from your inbox.

#### Accesing EhloMail Security interface

1. Navigate to the [EhloMail Dashboard](https://eu1.proofpointessentials.com/app/login.php?eid=10109)
2. Enter your login email address and password

_**Note**: You can also login to EhloMail Security from the digest emails._

The user interface allows you to check your inbound and outbound email logs, mark emails as spam or release them from the Quarantine, create lists of approved or blocked senders and more importantly, access your Emergency Inbox in case the mail server is temporarily unavailable.
