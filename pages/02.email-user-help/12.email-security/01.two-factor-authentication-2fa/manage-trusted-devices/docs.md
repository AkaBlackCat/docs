###Trusted Devices

EhloMail Web Client and the Touch Client allow you to specify whether a devices should be trusted or not, during the second stage of two-factor authentication. Once the computer/device is trusted you will only need to provide standard credentials, bypassing the two-factor codes here.

#### How to trust a computer/device
Once you enter the two-factor code in the login screen, you will have to select the check box **Trust this computer** and click **Verify** to trust the current computer/device. You are allowed to  trust more than one computer/device.

#### How to revoke a trusted computer/device

If you no longer use a certain device or you realise that particular device was compromised, you can revoke trusted access to your account by navigating to **Preferences** > **Accounts** > **Trusted Devices** in your EhloMail Web Client. 

Simply click on **revoke this device** to disassociate an individual device or click **revoke all other devices** to remove access for all.
