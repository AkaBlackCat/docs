The **Emergency Inbox** feature is used to provide you access to your email in the event that your email environment is
unavailable. 

Once this occurs, the email continuity solution will automatically begin to spool mail for your affected domain and
the emergency inbox will immediately begin to show the spooled mail. You will therefore still be able to send new messages as well as reply to received messages via the Emergency Inbox. 

_**Note**: Messages that were successfully delivered prior to mail delivery being impacted will NOT be displayed in the Emergency Inbox._

1. Log in to your [Email Security Dashboard](https://eu1.proofpointessentials.com/app/login.php?eid=10109). 
2. By default, you are at the **Home** page.
3. From here, you can go directly to the **Emergency Inbox**.
