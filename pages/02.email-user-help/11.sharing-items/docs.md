**Sharing** lets you give others access to different types of folders in your account: Mail folders, Contact lists, Calendars, Tasks etc. 

You specify which items to share and the level of access. You invite a user to share, and the user can accept or decline the invitation.

The Sharing page under Preferences helps you manage your shared items. This page shows the folders you shared with others and folders that are shared with you.

You can share your folders with specific internal users and external users or make a folder public.

**External and public users** can only view content - they cannot make changes. When you share a folder with internal users, you determine the type of access privileges to give the user. You can set permissions per user or group.

You can edit the access rights and revoke permissions at any time.

### Roles for Internal Users
You assign internal users or groups privileges using roles. The user or group must have a valid address in your company’s mail server.
* **Viewer**. Can read the contents of the shared folder, but cannot make changes to the content.
* **Manager**. Can view and edit the content of a shared folder, create new sub folders, edit and delete files in the shared folder.
* **Admin**. Can view, edit, add, remove, accept, decline, and administer content.
* **None**. Temporarily disables access to a shared folder without revoking the share privileges. Users still have the shared folder in their mailbox but cannot view or manage the content
You can share your mail folders, address books, calendars, and task lists folders. You invite a user to share, and the user can accept or decline the invitation.

### Sharing Folders 
1. Right-click the folder that you want to share.
2. Click **Share Folder**.
3. In the **Shared Properties** dialog box, select whether you want to share with internal, external, or public users. Depending on with whom you share, do the following:
4. For **Internal users or groups**, enter the user’s email addresses. 
5. In the **Role** area, select the access privileges.
6. For **External** guests, enter user’s email addresses. External guests are sent an email message with a link to the shared item. They create a display name and password the first time they go to view the shared item.
7. For **Public**, enter the URL to use.
8. In the **Message** area, select which type of message to send to those who you are granting access. This message can be sent to internal users and external guests. 
**Note**: If you selected Public, you must notify the public of the URL.
9. Click **OK**.

If the user accepts the invitation to share the folder, a copy of the folder is put in the user’s account.
