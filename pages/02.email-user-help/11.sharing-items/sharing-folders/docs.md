You can share any of your mail folders, including your **Inbox** folder, with internal and external users. You cannot share the **Trash** and **Junk** folders. Users that you share with can see the content of the folder but the information is not saved to their mailboxes.

Users that have the manager role have full permission to view and edit the contents of the shared mail folder, create new sub-folders, send email on the your behalf, and delete email messages.
Users with the admin role have full permission to view, edit the content of the mail folder, create new sub-folders, send email on your behalf, delete email messages, and share your mail folder with others.

Copies of the messages the user sends on your behalf are saved in your mailbox, and if the user deletes something from your mailbox or marks it as spam, the message is moved to your Trash folder or Junk folder.

If the user has access to more than one of your folders, the user can:
* Move the contents from one folder to another folder in your mailbox.
* Copy an email message from your folders to their mail folders. Your folder also retains a copy.
* Create folders within the shared mail folder. The new folder appears in the your mailbox.

### Scenarios for Sharing a Mail Folder
Your sales department wants one central mailbox for all email messages requesting information about a product, and everyone in sales should be able to view email messages when they come in. You can give everyone in the department permission to view the mail folder, and they can copy the messages to their mailbox. You could also give them permission to manage the mail folder and reply on behalf of this address.

A manager is often out of the office and does not have time to respond to email messages, so access is granted to the manager’s assistant. The assistant can respond to email on the manager’s behalf, create folders to organize messages, and delete messages.

Instead of sending email messages to dozens of addresses every time you have an announcement, you can identify one of your folders as a public folder that contains the email announcements. You can assign shared access to only specific email addresses and set a password that must be entered to view the content. Or you can create a URL, and anyone who has the URL can view the content.
