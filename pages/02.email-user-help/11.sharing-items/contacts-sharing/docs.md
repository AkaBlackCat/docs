You can share any of your contacts in your Contact List books with internal and external users. Sharing your address book is useful for giving others access to contacts for a specific project. 

Navigate to **Contacts** > **Contact Lists** > Right click on the list of contacts you want to share > **Share Contacts Folder**.

You can choose to make the contact list view-only or allow internal users to edit, add, and delete names or simply allow others access via direct URL share.
