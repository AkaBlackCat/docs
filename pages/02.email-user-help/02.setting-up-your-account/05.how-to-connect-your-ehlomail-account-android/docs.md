#### Android mail or Gmail app with Mobile Sync (paid module)

This additional module for mobile sync allows for instant PUSH notifications meaning you will not only be able to send and receive emails through your mobile device, but you will also be able to synchronize every new email, contact and appointment instantly. 

The steps below are very similar for both the default Android email client and the Gmail app. The important thing to note are the incoming / outgoing server settings which need to be configured manually as explained below:

1. **Settings** > **General Settings** > **Add Account** 
2. Setup **Email** > Select **Exchange and Office 365**
3. Enter your email address 
4. Tap on **Manual Setup**

8. The email client will check the server connection and once this is performed successfully you will be asked to allow remote control of your device so you can control your device from the EhloMail Web Client.
9. Tap OK and choose the sync frequency. 
10. Tap Next to move on to the last step.
11. Here you are able to review all the remote actions that you or your domain administrator, if the case, will be able to perform remotely.

12. To finish the configuration, select **Activate**.  

Your device will now show in the **Connected Devices & Apps** list and in case of the device being compromised, lost or stolen, you will be able to Wipe the data from the device remotely and disconnect your email account to avoid a privacy breach.
