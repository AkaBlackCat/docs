## Using Advanced and Standard Versions

The [EhloMail Web Client](https://mail.ls) (EMWC) has the following versions.
* The Advanced version offers the full set of Web collaboration features. This is usually the default setting. It works with most current browsers and faster Internet connections. 
* If you have a slow Internet connection or prefer HTML-based messaging, you can use the Standard version, which has many of the same features.

## Signing In and Signing Out

You must use a browser to run the EMWC. Not all browsers are supported, so check with your administrator.

When you Sign In to EMWC, you enter your username and password and select the version to use. You can select use the Default client, or change the client version. You can choose to stay signed in for the day, even if the browser closes by selecting the Stay signed in option.

If you leave your web client open, but do not access your mailbox for a period of time, your session might time out, and you need to sign back in.

### Sign In

* Open a browser window and enter the following URL [https://mail.ls](https://mail.ls) to access the Web Client.
* When the **Sign In** screen appears, type your username. You might be required to type your full email address as the username (for example, myra@example.com) and your password.
* To stay signed in until the session expires or you sign out, select **Stay signed in**.
* If you do not want to use your default client, you can change the version. Click the drop-down menu and select between **Advanced**, **Standard**, **Mobile**, or **Touch**.
* Click **Sign In**.

### Sign Out

To prevent others from having access to your email account, always sign out when you are not using your computer. If you browse to a different site without signing out first, your session might sign out automatically when it reaches the specified timeout.

In the top-right corner, click the arrow next to your name and select **Sign Out**.

### Choose a Default Client Version

You can set the default client version of EMWC at sign in. You can always switch to a different client version at sign in. 

* Go to the **Preferences** > **General** page.
* In the Sign in section, select how you want to sign in.
	* **Advanced** (Ajax). Offers the full set of Web collaboration features. The advanced client works best with newer browsers and faster Internet connections.
	* **Standard** (HTML). Recommended when Internet connections are slow or when using older browsers.
	* **Mobile**
	* **Touch**
* Click **Save**.

The next time you sign in, your selection appears as the default.

### If Your Session Expires

Your system might log you out if your session is inactive for a preconfigured period of time. Your administrator might also set a maximum amount of time that you can be logged in, regardless of whether any activity occurs. If you are automatically logged out, simply log in again and continue working.
