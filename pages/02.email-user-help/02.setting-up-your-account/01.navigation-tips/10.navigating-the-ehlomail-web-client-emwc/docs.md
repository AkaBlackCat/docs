The easiest way to gain access to your mailbox is through the web client. Navigate to the [EhloMail Web Client](https://mail.ls) and login with the credentials provided by your administrator. 

After you sign in, you will see a screen view similar to the one below. This view is the Mail view. The view changes when you use another application, such as Address Book or Calendar.
