It is strongly recommended that you update your default password at the initial login and select a new secret password that is only known by you. You can do this in two ways:  

### From inside the EhloMail Web Client dashboard 

1. Login to the [EhloMail Web Client](https://mail.ls) with your current credentials.
2. Go to the **Preferences** > **General page**.
3. In the **Sign in Options** > **Password**, click Change Password.
4. Enter your new password and click **Change password**.
5. Click **Save**.

### From the login page

If you have a [Secondary email address](https://help.mail.ls/email-user-help/setting-up-your-account/setup-your-password-recovery-account) configured on your account and you forgot your password, you can request a password reset via the [login screen](https://mail.ls). 

Click on "Forgot your password" > Fill in the email address for which you are trying to reset the password.

If you have trouble changing your password or have forgotten your password, or if you don't have a recovery email on record, please contact your administrator.
