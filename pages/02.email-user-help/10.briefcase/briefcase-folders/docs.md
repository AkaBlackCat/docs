3. Enter a **Name** for the new briefcase folder.
4. The briefcase folder name must be unique within the hierarchy of your all of mailbox folders. This name cannot match any top-level folder in your mailbox, calendar, or address book. For example, if you have a calendar named Holidays, you cannot name a top-level briefcase Holidays. Holidays could be a name of a briefcase within another briefcase.
5. Select the **Color** of the new briefcase file.
6. Select the folder hierarchy, either under **Folders** or under another briefcase folder. You can create a new top-level briefcase, or you can place it under an existing briefcase.
7. Click **OK**.

### Adding Files to Your Briefcase Folders
Uploading a file copies a file from your personal computer to your EMWC account. This makes the file available any time you log into your account. You can upload files in the following ways:
* Clicking attachments you receive with your email messages.
* Using the file upload tool when working in Briefcase
* Using WebDav Client tools

#### Upload Files from Briefcase
1. Go to the **Briefcase** tab and select the Briefcase to save the file.
2. Click **Upload File** and **Browse** to find the file to upload.
3. In the **Notes** text field, add any information about the file. This information is displayed in the file list.
4. To add another file, click Add.
5. You cannot upload a file with the same name to the same briefcase. If a file is uploaded that already exists in the folder, an Upload Conflict dialog displays. You can either click Yes to upload the file, overwriting the existing file, or click No.
6. The version number is updated if a file is overwritten.
7. When all files are uploaded, click **OK**.

_**Note**: If you selected the wrong briefcase, you can use drag and drop to move the file to the correct Briefcase folder._

If the file is too large, a warning displays. Files that you upload impact your account quota.
