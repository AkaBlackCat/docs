If your organization notifies you to apply an email message retention policy to your email folders, you set the retention policy for each folder. You do not set a retention policy on the Junk or Trash folders. You can also set your own custom policy for a folder.

Two options can be set up:
* **Message Retention**. When Enable Message Retention is selected, when you select to delete a message in the folder with a receive or sent date within the range configured, a warning displays stating that the message is within the folderâ€™s retention period to remind you not to delete the message.
* **Message Disposal**. Messages in the folder that are older than the time configured are automatically deleted. You are are not notified.

1. In the Navigation pane, right-click on a mail folder and select **Edit Properties**.
2. Click the **Retention** tab.
3. To set the retention policy, select **Enable Message Retention**.
4. In the **Retention Range** drop down list, select which retention policy to apply. If you are setting a custom policy, in the text box enter the number of years, months, weeks or days and select the period from the drop-down menu.
