You can set up the **Activity Stream** filter to have email messages that are less important, such as newsletters and social update communications, delivered to the Activity Stream folder instead of your Inbox. The Activity Stream Folder is added to your personal folders list in the Overview pane.

1. Click the gear icon in the Folders heading in the **Navigation pane** and select **Activity Stream**.
2. You can also set this up from the **Preferences** > **Filter** page, **Activity Stream Settings** link.
3. In the **Activity Stream** dialog box, select **Enable moving messages** into Activity Stream.
4. Select the type of messages to move. You can move the following type of messages:
* Messages where your address is not in the To or in the To or Cc field
* Messages from people not in your address book
* Messages sent to a distribution list that you are a member of
* Commercial mass marketing and bulk mail messages
5. Click OK.
6. In the information box that opens click Yes.
