You can configure your email preferences to notify you at another email address when you receive an email message to your EhloMail mailbox. This feature might be useful if you do not receive a lot of email to this account, but when you do receive email, it's important enough to require a timely response.

1. Go to the **Preferences** > **Mail** page.
2. In the **Receiving Messages** > **Message Arrival** section, select **Send a notification message to**.
3. Enter the email address in the text box.
4. Click **Save**.
