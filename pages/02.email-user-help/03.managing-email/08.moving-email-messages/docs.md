_**Note**: You can immediately undo the move. Click Undo that appears at the top of the page to move the message back to its original location._

You can sort your email messages in a folder by Subject, Size, Date, Attachment, Flag and Priority. You can only sort by one column at a time. In the Content pane header, right-click and select the sorting option. The header displays the sort order.

#### Group messages
In each of your folders, you can group message by date or by size in ascending or descending order.

When you group messages by date, messages display grouped by messages received today, yesterday, last week, two weeks ago, three weeks ago, last month and older.

When you group messages by size, messages display grouped by enormous (messages larger than 5MB) and tiny (messages less than 10KB), Grouping message by size is a good way to manage your mailbox quota by finding the largest messages to remove from your account.

1. Select the folder and in the Content pane header right-click and select **Group By**.
2. Select to group by date or size.
3. Select the order that the messages should be displayed.
