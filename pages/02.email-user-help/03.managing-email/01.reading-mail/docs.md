By default new messages are placed in your Inbox. If you have mail filter rules, new messages can appear in folders other than your Inbox. The number in parentheses next to each folder name indicates the number of unread messages within that folder.

#### Read a Message in Conversation View
1. To read a message in the Conversation view double-click the conversation containing the message. The individual messages display in the Reading pane.
* To expand the message to see all the conversations, click **Show quoted text** at the end of the message.
* To collapse the conversation view so only the last message is displayed, click **Hide quoted text** at the end of the message.
* To collapse all messages to view only the sender’s name and the snippet of the first line of the message, click the + icon in the message header.
2. To open the message, click the line that contains the message you want to read.

If you have **Reading Pane** enabled, the message body appears in the **Reading Pane**. Otherwise, double-click the message. The message is displayed in the **Content pane**.

#### Read a Message in Single Message View
* If the Reading Pane feature is enabled, click the message and read it in the Reading Pane.
* If the Reading Pane feature is not enabled, double-click the message. The message is displayed in the Content pane.

#### Mark a Message or Conversation as Unread
Conversations containing unread messages are shown in bold with a blue dot to the left of the sender’s name.
* To mark an entire conversation as unread in your Inbox, click the blue dot. When the conversation is expanded, all messages within the conversation display as unread and with blue dot.
* To mark an individual message in a conversation as unread, click the triangle to expand the conversation and click the dot next to the message you want to display as unread. The conversation displays in your Inbox as being unread, but when the conversation is expanded only the unread message displays with the blue dot.
