When you receive a message and you want to see message transport history, you can right-click on a message and select Show Original. The text page displays header information along with the text of the body of the message.

The email header is sometimes referred to as the envelope information. The message header details the path the message took from the sender to the recipients. The header includes the IP addresses, dates, and spam flagging information.

1. To find the origin of the message, right-click the message and select **Show Original**.
2. A new window opens with the information displayed. It should look similar to the example below:
