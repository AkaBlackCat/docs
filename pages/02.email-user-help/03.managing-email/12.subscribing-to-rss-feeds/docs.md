You can subscribe to Web sites that provide your favorite RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and podcast feeds to send updated information directly to your mailbox. You must know the URL of the feed to set up the subscription.

1. Click the gear icon in the Folders heading and select New Folder.
_**Note**: You must create a separate folder for each RSS feed. _
2. In the Name text box, type the name of the RSS feed folder.
3. Check Subscribe to RSS/ATOM feed.
4. Enter the URL for the feed in the URL field.
5. Select where to add the RSS feed folder in the folder menu. If you choose the root folder, the new folder is placed at the highest level in your folder view, which is the same level as your Inbox folder.
6. Click OK. The new folder appears in the Overview pane with the RSS feed icon.

Your RSS data feed is automatically updated every 12 hours. Click **Load Feed** in the toolbar to update the content at any time.

_**Note**: RSS feeds you save count against your account quota._
