**Contacts** is where you can store contact details. Two types of address lists are supported in the Web Client:
* Your personal contacts list, which consists of contacts you maintain. By default a **Contacts**, **Distributions Lists**, and an **Emailed Contacts** lists are created in **Contacts** section. You can create additional contact lists and share them with others.
* A **Global Address List** (GAL), sometimes called **Company Contacts**, is available to users within your organization. The GAL may contain convenience features such as distribution lists to facilitate communicating with an entire department.

_**Note**: You cannot edit GAL entries. You can, however, import an address once it appears in email you send or receive. You can add additional contact information when the name is in a list in your Contacts section._

You can add contacts to any of your contact lists. Only a name is required to create a contact, or you can create detailed contact forms that include full name, multiple email addresses, work, home, and other addresses, phone numbers, and an image. You can also create group contact lists.

The **Emailed Contacts** list is populated automatically when you send an email to a new address that is not in one of your other address books.

Your email administrator can set a maximum limit for the number of entries you can have in all your lists. When you reach this maximum, you cannot add any more contacts. You can delete contacts to free up space.

When you compose an email message, the auto-complete feature displays a list of names from your contact lists that match the text you are typing.
