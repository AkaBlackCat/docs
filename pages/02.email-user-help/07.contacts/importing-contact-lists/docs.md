### Importing a Contact List
You can import contact lists that are saved in a comma- separated (.csv) file. After the contacts are imported, they are alphabetized by last name in your Contacts.
1. Go to **Preferences** > **Import/Export** page.
2. In the **Import** > **File** text box, Browse and locate the .csv file to import.
3. Select the **Type** of contact list you are importing. You can select to auto- detect the contact list, or select from the contact lists in the drop-down menu.
4. Select the **Destination** contact list to import the contacts or create a new list.
5. If creating a new list, click **New** and enter a name, color and location for the new folder.
6. Click **OK**.
7. Click **Import**.
Depending on the size of the .csv file, the import might take a few minutes. When the import is complete, the **Status Box** shows the number of contacts successfully imported.

### Exporting an Contact List
You can export your contact list to a comma-separated (.csv) file.
1. Go to **Preferences** > **Import/Export** page.
