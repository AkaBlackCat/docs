A distribution list, also known as a mailing list, is a group of mail addresses contained in a list with a common mail address. When an email message is sent to a distribution list, the email is sent to everyone whose address is included in the distribution list.

You can view distribution lists in which you are a member and subscribe or unsubscribe to a distribution list.

_**Note**: only the domain administrator can create distribution lists._

### View a Distribution List
1. Go to the **Contacts** > **Contact Lists** page.
2. Select **Distribution Lists**. The right panel updates with a list of all the distribution lists you are a member or that you are the owner.

### Modify a Distribution List
You can modify a distribution list in which you are the owner.
1. Go to **Contacts** > **Contact Lists**.
2. Select **Distribution Lists**. The right panel updates with a list of all the distribution lists.
3. Select the distribution list you want to modify and click **Edit**. You must be the owner of the list or have permissions to modify the list.

### Subscribing to a Distribution List
You can subscribe to a distribution list if you know the name of the list and you are given the option to subscribe to the list, meaning it is open to new subscriptions. If the distribution list is not open to subscriptions, you must send an email message to the owner of the list and ask to be added.
