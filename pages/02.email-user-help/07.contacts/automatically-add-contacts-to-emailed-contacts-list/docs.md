You can automatically save the addresses that you send email to in your Emailed Contacts list. Any time you respond to, or compose a message that includes an address that is not in your address books, it is added to your **Emailed Contacts** list. If you are using the autocomplete feature, maintaining an **Emailed Contacts** list helps you quickly find addresses that you have emailed to in the past.
1. Go to the **Preferences** > **Contacts** page.
2. Under **Options** > **Settings**, select **Add new contacts to “Emailed Contacts”**.
